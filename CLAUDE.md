## Working the Loop (every agent — interactive too, not just skills)

These are house rules for anyone touching this repo's dev / PR / ticket workflow — whether you are
running a slash-command skill **or** working interactively and ad-hoc. They are **default
reflexes, not skill internals**: reach for them without being told, even on a one-off PR you opened
by hand. They defer their mechanism to the `catalyst-dev` plugin, available in every Catalyst-managed
repo. If that plugin is somehow unavailable, that is a broken environment — repair it (reload the
plugin) rather than routing around it. For GitHub state only, a single **bounded** `gh` check is an
acceptable last resort while you do; never a poll loop, and never a raw Linear API read (the
replica-read rule below is absolute).

- **Waiting on GitHub / CI / Linear state → subscribe to the event log, don't poll.** To block on a
  state change (a PR merged, CI turning green, a review posted, a push to a branch, a ticket
  transition), wait on the unified Catalyst event log instead of re-querying in a loop. Reach for
  the `catalyst-dev:wait-for-github` skill for GitHub events and `catalyst-dev:monitor-events` for
  the general wait-for-a-state-change pattern (they own the broker/webhook mechanics — don't
  reimplement them). A `gh` / `linearis` poll loop burns shared-quota API budget and silently misses
  reaction-only signals (next bullet). When the broker / webhook infra is down — or absent on a host
  with no event-log substrate — these skills degrade to a bounded single-event wait and a bounded
  poll becomes acceptable, but that degradation is the fallback, never your opening move.
- **Judging an automated code review → a clean pass is a reaction, not a review object.** The
  automated PR reviewer signals "no issues" with a 👍 reaction (or a terse "no major issues"
  comment) **instead of** opening review threads — detect it via the PR's reactions and issue
  comments, not only the reviews API. Recognizing the clean pass does **not** waive the rule that a
  PR is mergeable only once **every** review thread has been addressed and resolved.
- **Reading one Linear ticket → the freshness-gated local replica, not bare `linearis`.**
  Invoke the `catalyst-dev:linearis` skill and follow its "Reading Linear" contract — it reads the
  local replica behind a freshness gate (via its `linear_read_ticket` helper, run in the plugin's
  skill context) and does the loud stale/absent fallback for you. Don't hand-roll the read yourself:
  an **un-gated** `sqlite3` of the replica skips the freshness check (you may read stale data or
  create an empty DB), and a bare `linearis issues read <ID>` hits the rate-limited API and 429s the
  shared fleet quota — don't reach for it even as a fallback; the skill's helper owns the loud
  stale/absent path. Writes and list/search go through `linearis`.
